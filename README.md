## What's Inside

| Topic | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-------------------|
| Token Optimization | Model selection, system prompt slimming, background processes |
| Memory Persistence | Hooks that save/load context across sessions automatically |
| Continuous Learning | Auto-extract patterns from sessions into reusable skills |
| Verification Loops | Checkpoint vs continuous evals, grader types, pass@k metrics |
| Parallelization | Git worktrees, cascade method, when to scale instances |
| Subagent Orchestration | The context problem, iterative retrieval pattern |

---

## Cross-Platform Support

This plugin now fully supports **Windows, macOS, and Linux**. All hooks and scripts have been rewritten in Node.js for maximum compatibility.

### Package Manager Detection

The plugin automatically detects your preferred package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun) with the following priority:

1. **Environment variable**: `CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER`
2. **Project config**: `.claude/package-manager.json`
3. **package.json**: `packageManager` field
4. **Lock file**: Detection from package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb
5. **Global config**: `~/.claude/package-manager.json`
6. **Fallback**: First available package manager

To set your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Via environment variable
export CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER=pnpm

# Via global config
node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --global pnpm

# Via project config
node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --project bun

# Detect current setting
node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --detect
```

Or use the `/setup-pm` command in Claude Code.

## Ecosystem Tools

### Skill Creator

Two ways to generate Claude Code skills from your repository:

#### Option A: Local Analysis (Built-in)

Use the `/skill-create` command for local analysis without external services:

```bash
/skill-create                    # Analyze current repo
/skill-create --instincts        # Also generate instincts for continuous-learning
```

This analyzes your git history locally and generates SKILL.md files.

#### Option B: GitHub App (Advanced)

For advanced features (10k+ commits, auto-PRs, team sharing):

[Install GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/skill-creator) | [ecc.tools](https://ecc.tools)

```bash
# Comment on any issue:
/skill-creator analyze

# Or auto-triggers on push to default branch
```

Both options create:
- **SKILL.md files** - Ready-to-use skills for Claude Code
- **Instinct collections** - For continuous-learning-v2
- **Pattern extraction** - Learns from your commit history

### Continuous Learning v2

The instinct-based learning system automatically learns your patterns:

```bash
/instinct-status        # Show learned instincts with confidence
/instinct-import <file> # Import instincts from others
/instinct-export        # Export your instincts for sharing
/evolve                 # Cluster related instincts into skills
```

See `skills/continuous-learning-v2/` for full documentation.

---

## Requirements

### Claude Code CLI Version

**Minimum version: v2.1.0 or later**

This plugin requires Claude Code CLI v2.1.0+ due to changes in how the plugin system handles hooks.

Check your version:
```bash
claude --version
```

### Important: Hooks Auto-Loading Behavior

> ⚠️ **For Contributors:** Do NOT add a `"hooks"` field to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. This is enforced by a regression test.

Claude Code v2.1+ **automatically loads** `hooks/hooks.json` from any installed plugin by convention. Explicitly declaring it in `plugin.json` causes a duplicate detection error:

```
Duplicate hooks file detected: ./hooks/hooks.json resolves to already-loaded file
```

**History:** This has caused repeated fix/revert cycles in this repo ([#29](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/29), [#52](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/52), [#103](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/103)). The behavior changed between Claude Code versions, leading to confusion. We now have a regression test to prevent this from being reintroduced.

---

## Installation

### Option 1: Install as Plugin (Recommended)

The easiest way to use this repo - install as a Claude Code plugin:

```bash
# Add this repo as a marketplace
/plugin marketplace add xuxinchao007-prog/bgyfw-spect-code

# Install the plugin
/plugin install bgyfw-spect-code@bgyfw-spect-code
```

Or add directly to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "bgyfw-spect-code": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "xuxinchao007-prog/bgyfw-spect-code"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "bgyfw-spect-code@bgyfw-spect-code": true
  }
}
```

This gives you instant access to all commands, agents, skills, and hooks.

> **Note:** The Claude Code plugin system does not support distributing `rules` via plugins ([upstream limitation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference)). You need to install rules manually:
>
> ```bash
> # Clone the repo first
> git clone https://github.com/xuxinchao007-prog/bgyfw-spect-code.git
>
> # Option A: User-level rules (applies to all projects)
> cp -r bgyfw-spect-code/rules/* ~/.claude/rules/
>
> # Option B: Project-level rules (applies to current project only)
> mkdir -p .claude/rules
> cp -r bgyfw-spect-code/rules/* .claude/rules/
> ```

---

### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer manual control over what's installed:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/xuxinchao007-prog/bgyfw-spect-code.git

# Copy agents to your Claude config
cp bgyfw-spect-code/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Copy rules
cp bgyfw-spect-code/rules/*.md ~/.claude/rules/

# Copy commands
cp bgyfw-spect-code/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Copy skills
cp -r bgyfw-spect-code/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

#### Add hooks to settings.json

Copy the hooks from `hooks/hooks.json` to your `~/.claude/settings.json`.

#### Configure MCPs

Copy desired MCP servers from `mcp-configs/mcp-servers.json` to your `~/.claude.json`.

**Important:** Replace `YOUR_*_HERE` placeholders with your actual API keys.

## Key Concepts

### Agents

Subagents handle delegated tasks with limited scope. Example:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability
tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"]
model: opus
---

You are a senior code reviewer...
```

### Skills

Skills are workflow definitions invoked by commands or agents:

```markdown
# TDD Workflow

1. Define interfaces first
2. Write failing tests (RED)
3. Implement minimal code (GREEN)
4. Refactor (IMPROVE)
5. Verify 80%+ coverage
```

### Hooks

Hooks fire on tool events. Example - warn about console.log:

```json
{
  "matcher": "tool == \"Edit\" && tool_input.file_path matches \"\\\\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$\"",
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "#!/bin/bash\ngrep -n 'console\\.log' \"$file_path\" && echo '[Hook] Remove console.log' >&2"
  }]
}
```

### Rules

Rules are always-follow guidelines. Keep them modular:

```
~/.claude/rules/
  security.md      # No hardcoded secrets
  coding-style.md  # Immutability, file limits
  testing.md       # TDD, coverage requirements
```

---

## Running Tests

The plugin includes a comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
node tests/run-all.js

# Run individual test files
node tests/lib/utils.test.js
node tests/lib/package-manager.test.js
node tests/hooks/hooks.test.js
```

---

## Contributing

**Contributions are welcome and encouraged.**

This repo is meant to be a community resource. If you have:
- Useful agents or skills
- Clever hooks
- Better MCP configurations
- Improved rules

Please contribute! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

### Ideas for Contributions

- Language-specific skills (Python, Rust patterns) - Go now included!
- Framework-specific configs (Django, Rails, Laravel)
- DevOps agents (Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS)
- Testing strategies (different frameworks)
- Domain-specific knowledge (ML, data engineering, mobile)

---

## Background

This project is based on the excellent work by [Affaan Mustafa](https://github.com/affaan-m) and has been adapted and extended with additional language-specific agents and database specialists.

The original configurations are battle-tested across multiple production applications.

---

## Important Notes

### Context Window Management

**Critical:** Don't enable all MCPs at once. Your 200k context window can shrink to 70k with too many tools enabled.

Rule of thumb:
- Have 20-30 MCPs configured
- Keep under 10 enabled per project
- Under 80 tools active

Use `disabledMcpServers` in project config to disable unused ones.

### Customization

These configs work for my workflow. You should:
1. Start with what resonates
2. Modify for your stack
3. Remove what you don't use
4. Add your own patterns
